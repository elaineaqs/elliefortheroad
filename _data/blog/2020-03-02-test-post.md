### Let me help you edit your videos so you can save those hours into coming up with the BEST ideas to educate and serve your audience.

After giving birth to my daughter in 2018, I experienced a gnarly bout of postpartum blues. And I just had it with keeping small and invisible. So I started something out of the blue almost. An idea that sprouted while I was visiting family in our neighborhood. 

### I had a vision of starting a vlog, talking about beautiful things and memories in the midst of being in a somewhat messy reality. Finding beauty in the mess. 

For a time in 2019 to 2020, Beautiful Things and Memories became my creative journey towards resilience. I discovered so many things and met so many beautiful minds and souls. It activated in me something that was so different and took so much courage. 

### I know how it feels to be held back simply because the process of creating videos seems too much. 

**And I want to help you NOT feel that it's too much.**

I want to help you share your voice and inspire your audience.

**I want to help you activate in yourself that same courage, knowing you have someone on your side supporting you and your content in all the ways possible.**
