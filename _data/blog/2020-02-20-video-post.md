### Someone is looking for your creative genius! They are meant to find you and your creativity was meant for them too. Let me help you optimize your content so anyone, anywhere in the world who is online is able to discover your genius.

Let me tell you a story about a girl who was working in Dubai as a receptionist. She had a bit of time on her computer. And as she was working she felt the urge to search the Internet about marketing. Creative marketing. And then she found [Violeta Nedkova](https://violetanedkova.com). And then she found countless more other beautiful, creatively rebellious people like her.

That girl was me 7 years ago. In 2015, I began finding my very own tribe of people. People who get it. People who get me. Brilliant people who have created a business out of their strengths. I went home to the Philippines shortly thereafter and I became changed forever. It would take me a couple more years to finally step out of my shell. But it wouldn't have started if I hadn't seen these people when I randomly searched for something I wanted to learn about. You can be that person that people look for too. They just don't know it yet! 

Keeping up with SEO stuff can be daunting. Technology changes fast and, before you know it, there's another social media platform that's hot on the market. But the job of search engines remain the same: they try to give you the best results for whatever you are searching for.

### Let me help you in letting people find you online.
