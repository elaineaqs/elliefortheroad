### Social media is for social interaction. Let me help you manage your social media so you can spend more time with your audience. Let them know you care because you deeply do!

My own journey with social media hasn't been the smoothest. Lots of things happen when you're dealing with other even though it's all virtual. You know?

But the biggest barrier to me was always not being able to create and share consistently.

That might be the same for you too. And, like me, you might be imagining a world where you donâ€™t have to do some parts of the content creation and sharing process. Where someone would just be there to support you, listen to you, strategize and build with you.

See, I'm not just here to assist you. You can get that anywhere.

### What we're really doing is saying YES to the potential that is reaching your audience no matter the algorithm changes and the hurdles you might face along the way.

What I'm really saying is I'm here to take your account and make it stick in people's minds and hearts.

What we're getting at is you on social media as your most authentic self. It's time to be heard and seen. The world awaits your magic, creativity, and services.

## **Here's how it works:**

1. Hop on a call if you want to; and/ or
2. Choose how long you want to work together (short, medium, longer term)
3. Payment and onboarding
4. Working together and access to your customer dashboard
5. Final hand off and offboarding, a beautiful farewell session ceremony (jk) 

## **This is for you if:**

* you are looking for someone who can manage your social media for you
* you want to offload Social Media Management for a specific period of time
* you care about being found, seen, and heard online ðŸ’œ

## This is NOT for you if:

* you don't think Social Media Management services are necessary for your business or project
* you want to manage your social media yourself
* you sell things that are unethical or harmful to anyone

## What you get:

* a social media + process audit
* a checklist of things to improve
* social media management services
* customer dashboard
* optional discovery or initial virtual meeting
