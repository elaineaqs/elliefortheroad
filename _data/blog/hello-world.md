**Do you know that feeling when you're good at something and that something is so easy and fun for you that you feel it's a disservice to be paid for it?**

*That's* how I feel about offering my website services.

But I realize it's an even greater disservice to not be paid for doing work when you love it and especially when it's easy and fun for you!

### When I learned how to create websites at 15, I felt so much *power!*

You mean you can write anything and publish it online for anyone to see for free? That was power for me. That meant you can connect with virtually anyone on the planet with an Internet connection. That meant you get to be published and create spaces for people to cultivate their passions and interests and even discover their purpose. You can influence people with your message without limits!

But you can't do that when even the basics of setting things up get in the way. And these days you get to learn about technical things by clicking the search button. And you can do that too.

**But how about doing that plus more?**

### Taking your website and making it appear when people search for your products, services, or published online information.

Letting someone who not only knows what they're doing but keeping up to date with the latest in web development and design. 

Taking your website and making sure it's being shared by your audience. Creating content that people love to repost on their feeds and stories.

Using your website to nurture your community. Becoming a hub and home for everything related to your content and business. Not relying heavily on platforms to build your business around. 

That's how powerful your website can be.

**Your website is not just a fancy portfolio thing you put out there for people to admire. It is a living, breathing, smarter way to share your voice!**

Share your voice.

Content Creators, let's get to work!
